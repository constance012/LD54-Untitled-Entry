## __DESCRIPTION__
You’re a private detective who gets to investigate about an unknown substance being experimented on humans that turned them into atrocious monsters. Because of the urge to find the truth behind all of this and bring it to the light, you went to an abandoned laboratory in which the evidences led to. But little that you know, what’s lurking behind the darkness is far more the you could imagine.
